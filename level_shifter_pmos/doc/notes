when the difference between the driving logic voltage and
the pmos transistor gate voltage is greater than the gate
to source allowed voltage, a level shifter is needed. its
goal is to provide a DC offset with through the voltage
divider R2 R3. a transistor Q2 reference the divider to
the ground. the voltage divider is followed by a totem
pole transistor configuration, which drives the pmos M1.
